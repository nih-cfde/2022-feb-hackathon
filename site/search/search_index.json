This hackathon has both synchronous and asynchronous work, with concentrated hackathon sessions on specific data sets. Participants can attend whichever hackathon sessions they are interested in. Participants can also form working groups and tackle issues throughout the week organized in a GitHub repository. There is no minimum work requirement, all are welcome to participate as much or as little as schedules and interest allow! Hackathon Benefits Gain experience with Common Fund data sets and have access to data set curators! See an immediate product from a short burst of concentrated effort! Meet researchers with common interests and potentially spur collaborations or funding efforts! Participant Skill Level The hackathon is open to the public, and anyone can attend. Despite the name \u201chackathon\u201d, participants don\u2019t need to be experts in computer science! The most important criteria is interest in the data sets, and some familiarity with the command line and GitHub is helpful but not required.

We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody. The CFDE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of Consortium members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any venue, including meetings, presentations, or discussions. The Less Quick Version Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact our Code of Conduct Team immediately. If you would prefer to remain anonymous, you can email that address using a free single-anonymous email service like Anonymouse We expect participants to follow these guidelines at any CFDE event.
