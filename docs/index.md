# NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem Hackathon 

We are pleased to announce that the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) will be hosting an online hackathon on NIH Common Fund data sets from **February 21 - 25, 2022**. The [hackathon schedule](https://nih-cfde.github.io/2022-feb-hackathon/schedule/) has both synchronous and asynchronous work, with concentrated hackathon sessions on specific data sets. Participants can attend whichever hackathon sessions they are interested in. Participants can also form working groups and tackle issues throughout the week organized in the [hackathon GitHub repository](https://github.com/nih-cfde/2022-feb-hackathon). 

#### Hackathon Benefits

- Gain experience with [Common Fund data sets](https://nih-cfde.github.io/2022-feb-hackathon/about/) and have access to data set curators!
- See an immediate product from a short burst of concentrated effort!
- Meet researchers with common interests and potentially spur collaborations or funding efforts!

#### Participation

The hackathon is open to the public, and anyone can attend. Despite the name “hackathon”, participants don’t need to be experts in computer science! The most important criteria is interest in the data sets, and some familiarity with the command line and GitHub is helpful. There is no minimum work requirement, all are welcome to participate as much or as little as schedules and interest allow! Everyone who participates is required to conform to the CFDE [Code of Conduct](https://nih-cfde.github.io/2022-feb-hackathon/CODEOFCONDUCT/). 

**Registration is free but required. [Click here to register](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/hackathon/).**
