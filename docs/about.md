#### [Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Search Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/)

The [CFDE search portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/) provides metadata
search functionality across
[NIH Common Fund data](https://commonfund.nih.gov/) for many
programs. Guided hackathon activities for this round will focus on
accessing, exporting, and working with Human Microbiome Project data
sets, but we encourage participants to explore all of the data available
through the portal!

#### [Extracellular RNA Communication (exRNA)](https://exrna-atlas.org/)

[exRNA](https://exrna-atlas.org/) is small RNA sequences and qPCR-derived exRNA profiles from human and mouse biofluids with over 7,500 entries. The exRNA session will describe two use cases:

1) Exploring RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) and their associated RNA cargo in a various human biofluids and their potential utility as biomarkers, using data from the exRNA Atlas [https://exrna-atlas.org/](https://exrna-atlas.org/).

2) Interrogating other sites across the genome by intersecting exRNA Atlas data with regions of interest using BedGraph files (“data slicing”), and the broader application of this approach to non-RBP sites and other data sets. 

#### [Metabolomics Workbench (MW)](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/)

[Metabolomics Workbench](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/) (MW) is the NIH Common Fund's National Metabolomics Data Repository (NMDR). The MW provides a platform to deposit metabolomics data by researchers across the world, and provides tools to browse, analyze and visualize such data and the related metabolite structures and annotations. Currently, the MW has about 1,700 publicly released studies. The MW metabolite database currently has more than 164,000 entries with the ability to search by text, substructure and m/z values. Tutorials about various aspects of the MW data are provided [here](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/tutorials.php). 

#### [Signature Commons Library of Integrated Network-Based Cell Signatures (LINCS)](https://maayanlab.cloud/sigcom-lincs/#/SignatureSearch/UpDown)

[SigCom LINCS](https://maayanlab.cloud/sigcom-lincs/#/SignatureSearch/UpDown) is web-based search engine representing over 1.5 million gene expression signatures processed, visualized, and analyzed from LINCS, GTEx, and GEO databases.

#### [Human Microbiome Project](https://portal.hmpdacc.org/)

[HMP](https://portal.hmpdacc.org/) is contains over 31,000 samples from 48 sites on the human body. The HMP session will involve pulling data from this portal and assembling it with Amazon Web Services.
