Hackathon Benefits Gain experience with Common Fund data sets and have access to data set curators! See an immediate product from a short burst of concentrated effort! Meet researchers with common interests and potentially spur collaborations or funding efforts! Participation The hackathon is open to the public, and anyone can attend. Despite the name \u201chackathon\u201d, participants don\u2019t need to be experts in computer science! The most important criteria is interest in the data sets, and some familiarity with the command line and GitHub is helpful. There is no minimum work requirement, all are welcome to participate as much or as little as schedules and interest allow!

We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody. The CFDE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of Consortium members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any venue, including meetings, presentations, or discussions. The Less Quick Version Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact our Code of Conduct Team immediately. If you would prefer to remain anonymous, you can email that address using a free single-anonymous email service like Anonymouse We expect participants to follow these guidelines at any CFDE event.

Guided hackathon activities for this round will focus on accessing, exporting, and working with Human Microbiome Project data sets, but we encourage participants to explore all of the data available through the portal! Extracellular RNA Communication (exRNA) exRNA is small RNA sequences and qPCR-derived exRNA profiles from human and mouse biofluids with over 7,500 entries. The exRNA session will describe two use cases: 1) Exploring RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) and their associated RNA cargo in a various human biofluids and their potential utility as biomarkers, using data from the exRNA Atlas https://exrna-atlas.org/ . 2) Interrogating other sites across the genome by intersecting exRNA Atlas data with regions of interest using BedGraph files (\u201cdata slicing\u201d), and the broader application of this approach to non-RBP sites and other data sets. Metabolomics Workbench (MW) Metabolomics Workbench (MW) is the NIH Common Fund's National Metabolomics Data Repository (NMDR). The MW provides a platform to deposit metabolomics data by researchers across the world, and provides tools to browse, analyze and visualize such data and the related metabolite structures and annotations. Currently, the MW has about 1,700 publicly released studies. The MW metabolite database currently has more than 164,000 entries with the ability to search by text, substructure and m/z values. Tutorials about various aspects of the MW data are provided here . Signature Commons Library of Integrated Network-Based Cell Signatures (LINCS) SigCom LINCS is web-based search engine representing over 1.5 million gene expression signatures processed, visualized, and analyzed from LINCS, GTEx, and GEO databases. Human Microbiome Project HMP contains over 31,000 samples from 48 sites on the human body. The HMP session will involve pulling data from the portal and assembling it with Amazon Web Services.","title":"Potential Projects"},{"location":"about/#common-fund-data-ecosystem-cfde-search-portal","text":"The CFDE search portal provides metadata search functionality across NIH Common Fund data for many programs.
